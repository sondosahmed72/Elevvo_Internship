# Traffic Sign Recognition

## Description
This project recognizes German traffic signs using deep learning (CNN) with the GTSRB dataset.

## Dataset
- [GTSRB Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/meowmeowmeowmeowmeow/gtsrb-german-traffic-sign)
- The German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark (GTSRB) is a **multi-class, single-image classification** dataset.
- Contains **more than 50,000 images** of traffic signs.
- Covers **over 40 different classes** of German traffic signs.
- Images vary in size, lighting, and orientation to simulate real-world conditions.
- Originally used in the IJCNN 2011 competition for traffic sign recognition.
